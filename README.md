# Push-To-Talk (PTT) App for Android

This is a sample PTT app, following the [**browser-based PTT**](https://github.com/FihlaTV/ptt) application. The app is divided into 2 parts: native implementation and web-view based implementation.    
[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)-based implementation connects to the same web site as the browser version.    
The sound is recorded using [AudioRecord](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html?hl=en) for both native and webview implementation.    
WebView uses [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) to play back audio and native implementation uses [AudioTrack](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack).
